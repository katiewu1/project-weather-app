# Weather App

Create a Weather App in a group to practice Mob-programming. Working with branches on GitHub and using APIs.

For the group project's repo: https://github.com/efstasia/project-weather-app

This repo that you are reading now, is a repo that I used to practice to implement a search field to fetch another city's weather forecast. And for testing to fetch other data.
